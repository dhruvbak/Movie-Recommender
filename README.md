# Movie-Recommender
#### Collaborative filtering based KNN movie recommendation system using cosine similarity
Recommender systems are broadly classified into two types based on the data being used to make inferences:
1.	Content-based filtering, which uses item attributes.
2.	Collaborative filtering, which uses user behaviour (interactions) in addition to item attributes.

In this project dataset of movies and rating is combined, threshold of minimum 50 ratings per movie is kept. Then one movie is selected randomly; and using KNN and cosine similarity, 10 movies are recommended based on their distance from randomly selected movie.
